### Preparation

My first time to do a trip plan. Anyway, analyze the map first.

Then search for **One Day Pass Ticket**.

### Sunset

We saw the sunset, listening to music 🎵 together, on the bridge.  
🌆 At that time, I wanted to hug her.

### Ferris Wheel

When we on the **Ferris Wheel**, I was too nervous to tell her that I have fallen in love with her 😅

However, thanks to 9 o'clock for giving me inspiration, I finally did it 💕
