### Matsuri

That Sunday, we went to the Kadajinjya Matsuri with Brother Bao and Wan Qiuer. The Matsuri was a traditional gathering where people surrounding the center stage and following the traditional dance of performers, sort of like the square dance in China hahahaha.

People all seemed to be into the dance, slowly waved their arms together accompanied by old Japanese songs. The air was a bit humid, music and laughters flowing around the ear, the color of red, green and golden of the Shrine glowing under the light by hundreds of paper lanterns, women’s Yukata, flowers pinned in hair bun, little stands selling タコ焼き and かき氷, just like the scene in Japanese anime.

### Mini-hanabi Show

After the matsuri, Wan Qiuer came up with the idea of playing hand-held fireworks along the riverside, so we visited several convenient stores and finally bought a huge pack of mini fireworks. We found a place along the Sumidagawa river, the wind was little bit strong at that night, so it was laborious for the lighter to light the firework. Besides that, there was so much fun playing fireworks. We used them to draw a lot of letters and words.
