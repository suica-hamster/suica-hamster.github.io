### 100 Days Celebration

Long time no update! We are too busy with our study. スイカ君 went on a “タピオカ” business trip in Taiwan😍.

This is our photo chatting history on those days: (See, this guy’s trip was occupied by nothing but robots and pearl milk tea, maybe a little part of snacks in night market, motorcycle and golf as well:D)

As I am staying in the city with expensive yet unsavory milk tea, my face was 👇

However, he brought back many snacks for me. I love the pineapple cake so much! 😆

Btw, スイカ君 had a new haircut in Taiwan. At first, I prefer him to have long hair with natural curls, so after hearing his hair had been cut much shorter, I felt a bit depressed in the phone. But when he came to me in person, I am so satisfied with the new look. Perhaps this is so-called “beauty lies in the lover’s eyes”. Anyway, SUICA thought it should owe to the fact that he is a イケメン himself.

Yesterday was our one-hundred-day anniversary. I wrote a long letter for SUICA. I am sure he hasn’t read it at the moment because I am too shy to let him read right in front of me. We had Sushi for dinner, a nice treat after my long studying day.
p.s. Sorry for my piggy snoring and occupying the quilt. (・ω・)zzZZ
